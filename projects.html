                    The bedside table lamp was constructed from 1-inch iron piping, with a switch mechanism made from a red garden hose handwheel valve. Originally designed for garden hose use, the valve had been repurposed to control the flow of electricity to the lamp. Its bold color provided a striking contrast to the lamp's dark metal tones. The entire lamp rested on a square of 3/4-inch plywood.

                    The "Don't Mess With Texas." sign was hand cut out of 1/2-inch plywood. Each individual piece of the design is layered on top of one another to create a three-dimensional effect, with round-headed screws adding an industrial element to the piece. The iconic campaign has been a symbol of Texas pride and environmental stewardship for decades, serving as a bold reminder of the importance of preserving our natural surroundings.

                    The glass rack is made entirely out of 1/2-inch copper piping, carefully shaped to create a sleek and minimalist design that maximizes functionality while remaining visually appealing. The piping is meticulously sanded to a brushed copper look, enhancing the natural beauty and warmth of the copper.
