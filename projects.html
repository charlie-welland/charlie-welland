                    The desk is crafted from 3/4-inch plywood, providing a sturdy and aesthetic workspace. It features lighting made from 1-inch iron piping, which are controlled by a garden hose valve, adding an industrial touch. The desk includes five custom-made soft-closing drawers with aluminum engraving plates to improve organization and ease of access. Tools are hung on the walls, ensuring they are within easy reach. The desk is still in development.

                    The glass rack is made entirely out of 1/2-inch copper piping, carefully shaped to create a sleek and minimalist design that maximizes functionality while remaining visually appealing. The piping is meticulously sanded to a brushed copper look, enhancing the natural beauty and warmth of the copper.

                    The "Don't Mess With Texas." sign was hand cut out of 1/2-inch plywood. Each individual piece of the design is layered on top of one another to create a three-dimensional effect, with round-headed screws adding an industrial element to the piece. The iconic campaign has been a symbol of Texas pride and environmental stewardship for decades, serving as a bold reminder of the importance of preserving our natural surroundings.

                    These two shelves were crafted from 3/4-inch maple plywood, designed to enhance both functionality and aesthetics. Each shelf is angled to optimize viewing, ensuring that the items displayed catch the eye effortlessly. To prevent items from sliding off, a lip is attached to the front edge of each shelf, secured firmly with dowels and wood glue. This design choice not only adds a practical element but also contributes to the overall fidelity and visual appeal of the shelving unit.

                    The bedside table lamp was constructed from 1-inch iron piping, with a switch mechanism made from a red garden hose handwheel valve. Originally designed for garden hose use, the valve had been repurposed to control the flow of electricity to the lamp. Its bold color provided a striking contrast to the lamp's dark metal tones. The entire lamp rested on a square of 3/4-inch plywood.

                    The wall niche is made out of 1/4-inch plywood, cut on a laser cutter. Using a finger joint technique, the box is glued together and installed into the wall to create a recessed cubby. The niche contains a 120-Volt electrical outlet installed to charge devices at night.
